# The Intranet
The intranet is a project for an alt-internet, going for an older style, culture and general vibe.

## About the old Intranet Project
I chose to end development of that project, for the sake of a new, more modern codebase. Aditionally, I chose to prioritize the ability to connect to this webpage, from anywhere on the regular internet, instead of having to download it locally on your machine.

## Aditional bonuses:
1. Internet
2. Modern HTML & CSS
3. Larger install-base
4. JS (and not VBscript & flash)
5. Forums
